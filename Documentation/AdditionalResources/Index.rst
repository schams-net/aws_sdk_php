TYPO3 Extensions Using EXT:aws\_sdk\_php
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several TYPO3 extensions which use EXT:aws\_sdk\_php.
However, we have not compiled a list of those yet.


AWS SDK for PHP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For in-depth user guides, API documentation, developer forums, and other
developer resources, see the **AWS SDK for PHP** section at aws.amazon.com:

`<https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/>`_

The code repository is hosted on **Github**:

`<https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php>`_

The **complete API documentation** can be found at:

`<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/latest/>`_

A **README** is available at:

A migration guide shows how to migrate your code to use Version 3 of the
AWS SDK for PHP and how the new version differs from the Version 2 of the SDK:

`<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/guide/guide/migration.html>`_


The TYPO3 CMS Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You possibly already noticed that the TYPO3 extension is basicly just a
wrapper of the *AWS SDK for PHP*, wich makes it easy to use this fantastic
library in this awesome content management system.

The author's website contains some more information:
