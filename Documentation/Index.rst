.. note::

   This TYPO3 CMS extension does not do anything itself. It acts as a "wrapper"
   for the `AWS SDK for PHP <https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/>`_ software
   and provides AWS services to developers.

|

A SDK (software development kit) is a set of software development tools
which provide functions for other applications (e.g. other TYPO3
extensions). In this case, the extension **EXT:aws\_sdk\_php** builds an
interface between TYPO3 CMS and AWS' services. The extension and *AWS SDK
for PHP* enables PHP developers to use Amazon Web Services in their PHP
code and build TYPO3 frontend and backend extensions using services like
`Amazon S3 <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_,
`Amazon Route 53 <http://aws.amazon.com/route53>`_,
`Amazon RDS <http://aws.amazon.com/rds>`_,
`Amazon DynamoDB <http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb>`_,
`Amazon Glacier <http://aws.amazon.com/glacier>`_,
etc.
